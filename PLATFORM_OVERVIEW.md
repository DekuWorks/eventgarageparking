# Event Garage Parking - Platform Overview

## 🎯 Mission Statement
**Make event parking affordable, convenient, and stress-free by connecting homeowners with unused parking spaces to event attendees who need them.**

---

## 🚗 What Is Event Garage Parking?

**Event Garage Parking** is a web-based peer-to-peer parking marketplace, similar to Airbnb but for parking spaces.

### The Core Concept
Instead of paying $40 to park in a crowded lot far from the venue, event attendees can:
- Book a homeowner's driveway or garage
- Park closer to the event
- Pay less (typically $10-25)
- Walk shorter distances
- Have a guaranteed spot

### Why This Works

#### For Event Attendees (Customers)
- ✅ **Save Money**: 50-70% cheaper than traditional event parking
- ✅ **Better Location**: Park in neighborhoods right near the venue
- ✅ **Guaranteed Spot**: Pre-book your parking, no driving around looking
- ✅ **Easy Access**: Get exact address and directions via email
- ✅ **Verified & Safe**: All hosts are verified, read reviews from other customers

#### For Homeowners (Hosts)
- ✅ **Extra Income**: Earn $500-2000/month listing your unused driveway
- ✅ **No Work Required**: Just keep your driveway clear on event days
- ✅ **You Control Everything**: Set your own prices and availability
- ✅ **Safe & Secure**: Customers are verified, platform handles all payments
- ✅ **Insurance Protection**: Platform covers liability (future feature)

## 💰 Business Model

### Revenue
- **15-20% service fee** on each booking (split between customer and host)
- **Premium listings** for hosts ($19.99/mo for featured placement)
- **Subscription plans** for frequent customers (5% off all bookings)

### Example Transaction
- Customer books spot for $20
- Platform fee: $4 (20%)
- Host receives: $16
- Platform earns: $4

### Market Opportunity
- Sports stadiums host 50-100 events/year
- Each event = 10,000-50,000 attendees needing parking
- Concert venues, festivals, conferences = huge market
- Even capturing 1% of event parking = millions in revenue
